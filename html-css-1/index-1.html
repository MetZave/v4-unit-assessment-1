            <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and latest major version of HTML, that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recomendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Mircosoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</p>
            <p>HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, oarsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backword-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.</p>
